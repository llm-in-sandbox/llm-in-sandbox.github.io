You requested this advice through Industry Innovation and Science Australia’s\n   126\tStatement of Expectations dated 1 December 2022.\n   127\t\n   128\tAustralia is well-known for its world class research performance. However, this is not translating to\n   129\tcommercialisation outcomes to grow and diversify the economy and deliver secure well-paid jobs.\n   130\tOur insights are grounded in the context of the Australian innovation ecosystem including industry\n   131\tstructure.\n   132\t\n   133\tIndustry Innovation and Science Australia (IISA), with its expertise and connections to businesses and\n   134\tacademia across the economy, has investigated the complex challenges faced in the pursuit of\n   135\tinnovation and commercialisation outcomes. These include the practical challenges of engaging with\n   136\tresearch entities, and the barriers within the innovation process in the context of the Australian\n   137\tindustry structure, market dynamics and policy landscape.\n   138\t\n   139\tIn preparing our advice, we have focused on the Australian Government’s overarching policy\n   140\tobjectives of industrial and economic transformation, sustainable value creation, high-value job\n   141\tcreation and economic diversification. We have also considered related reviews and strategies such\n   142\tas the University Accord review.\n   143\t\n   144\tOur report provides recommendations and practical actions for your consideration. The actions we\n   145\tpropose are harmonious with the design and implementation of flagship initiatives such as the\n   146\tNational Reconstruction Fund and the Industry Growth Program. We include policy advice to reflect\n   147\twhat is required to build industry capability and capacity to innovate, collaborate and\n   148\tcommercialise.\n   149\t\n   150\tOn behalf of the IISA Board, we look forward to working with you and the department on\n   151\timplementing these important actions to strengthen business productivity in growing markets and\n   152\tsupport the creation of well-paid jobs through the transformation and diversification of Australia’s\n   153\teconomy. Finally, my appreciation to IISA members Ms Lauren Stafford and Dr Doron Samuell for\n   154\tleading this work and my sincere thanks to the Office of IISA for their ongoing support.\n   155\t\n   156\tYours sincerely\n   157\t\n   158\t**Andrew Stevens**\n   159\tChair\n   160\tIndustry Innovation and Science Australia Board\n   161\t25 September 2023\n   162\t\n   163\t\n   164\t-----\n   165\t\n   166\t## Executive summary\n   167\t\n   168\tThis report, through its analysis, provides a new perspective on barriers to industry-research\n   169\tcollaboration and commercialisation. It complements policy discussions that have primarily focused\n   170\ton supply-side barriers and accompanying strategies designed to increase university research push.[1]\n   171\tPublic policy debate around industry-research collaboration has emphasised supply-side policy\n   172\tinstruments. These include indirect and direct Government Expenditure on R&D (GERD) and other\n   173\tinvestments to foster collaboration between the private sector and research institutions.[2]\n   174\t\n   175\tOur analysis reframes the problem. First and foremost, barriers to collaboration and achieving\n   176\tcommercialisation outcomes should be grounded in an understanding of the need or demand for\n   177\tthese outcomes.

But has there been a corresponding decline in competition?\n    14\t\n    15\tDynamic markets are important for competition. Dominant firms in\n    16\tconcentrated markets may still act competitively if there is some threat\n    17\tfrom new entrants or growing competitors.\n    18\t\n    19\tIn this research note we examine the link between measures of market\n    20\tconcentration and firm dynamism at a detailed industry level.\n    21\t\n    22\tFirst, we find that the largest firms in concentrated industries are less likely\n    23\tto be displaced from their positions over time. In addition, as an industry\n    24\tbecomes more concentrated, the number of new entrants tends to shrink.\n    25\t\n    26\tSecond, we find that concentrated markets often display more anticompetitive behaviour, as measured by infringement notices issued by the\n    27\tcompetition regulator. Petrol stations that operate in environments with\n    28\tfewer nearby competitors also tend to charge consumers higher margins.\n    29\t\n    30\tOverall, these findings raise concerns about the exercise of market power\n    31\tby dominant players in concentrated markets, suggesting that the observed\n    32\trise in product market concentration is unlikely to be purely benign.\n    33\t\n    34\t\n    35\t## Summary\n    36\t\n    37\t\n    38\t-----\n    39\t\n    40\t## Does rising market concentration mean weakening competiton?\n    41\t\n    42\t\n    43\tLikewise, the scarcity of new entrants into concentrated industries suggests a\n    44\tlack of external competitive pressure. Our findings indicate there are fewer new\n    45\tfirms entering an industry after an industry experiences an increase in\n    46\tconcentration.\n    47\t\n    48\tMarket concentration also becomes a concern if it coincides with anti-competitive\n    49\tbehaviours, such as when include market leaders intentionally restrict consumer\n    50\tchoice or prevent suppliers from doing business with other competitors. 6\n    51\t\n    52\tOur research establishes a correlation between market concentration and anticompetitive behaviours. We find that firms operating in concentrated industries are\n    53\tmore prone to infringements from the competition regulator.\n    54\t\n    55\tFinally, we conduct a case study into the anti-consumer effects of local market\n    56\tconcentration, using microdata on petrol stations. Stations facing limited nearby\n    57\tcompetitors use this advantage by charging higher margins at the pump.\n    58\t\n    59\t\n    60\tRising industry concentration has recently been observed in many developed\n    61\teconomies, which raises concerns about the increased power of market leaders\n    62\tand the overall state of competition.\n    63\t\n    64\tAn increase in concentration does not necessarily arise from anti-competitive\n    65\tbehaviour. Some markets have a \"winner takes all\" dynamic, where the most\n    66\tproductive company dominates. Technology has made it easier for consumers to\n    67\tcompare the prices of similar products. If one firm can make a better product at a\n    68\tlower price and capture the market, then this may be an efficient outcome.1,2,3\n    69\t\n    70\tFor these markets to remain competitive, they need the ongoing threat of\n    71\tobsolescence. This enables consumers to switch to a more innovative or cheaper\n    72\tcompetitor, such as when Apple made Nokia's mobile phones obsolete during the4\n    73\t2010s.5\n    74\t\n    75\tWe investigate market concentration in Australia at the industry level and its link\n    76\twith measures of market dynamism such as:\n    77\t\n    78\t\n    79\t**Incumbent retention: How long do the top firms stay in their**\n    80\tposition?\n    81\t\n    82\t**Net entry: Are there more new entries relative to exits in the**\n    83\tindustry?\n    84\t\n    85\t\n    86\t**1.**\n    87\t\n    88\t**2.**\n    89\t\n    90\t\n    91\tWithout changes in the ranking of leaders within an industry, it becomes\n    92\tchallenging to assert that the top firms in concentrated industries face the\n    93\tthreat of obsolescence.

To account for this effect, we\n   227\tdivide the sample into two distinct periods: 2007-14 and 2015-21. We also aim to\n   228\taddress the persistent nature of this mechanical effect over time, therefore our\n   229\tmeasure of net entry in the 2015-21 period controls for the net entry rate observed\n   230\tin the 2007-14 period.\n   231\t\n   232\tOur findings suggest that increases in industry concentration during the 2007-14\n   233\tperiod are associated with a lower rate of net entry in the following period (2015-21)\n   234\t(Figure 7). It is important to note that we are not inferring causality in this context.\n   235\tInstead, we observe that the conditions linked to concentration growth in one period\n   236\tare correlated with diminished net entry of firms in the subsequent period.\n   237\t\n   238\t\n   239\tFor a 10 percentage point increase in the share of the top 10 firms between 2007\n   240\t\n   241\tand 2014, the average annual net entry rate in that industry was 0.6 percentage\n   242\t\n   243\tpoints lower in 2015-21 after controlling for the net entry rate in 2007-14.\n   244\t\n   245\t\n   246\t-----\n   247\t\n   248\t## More concentrated industries infringe consumer rules more often\n   249\t\n   250\tThe power dynamics between leading firms and consumers may become imbalanced in\n   251\tconcentrated markets. To examine this further, we rank industries based on their\n   252\taverage CR10 ratio from 2007 to 2021. We then estimate the number of consumerrelated infringements and undertakings issued by the ACCC over the past 3 decades. To\n   253\taccount for varying industry sizes, we calculate infringements per 1,000 firms.\n   254\t\n   255\tThe industries with the highest levels of concentration also tend to have higher rates\n   256\tof consumer contraventions (Figure 8). For example, on the ACCC website:\n   257\t\n   258\t\n   259\tThere have been 12 infringement notices and enforceable undertakings issued\n   260\tover 30 years in the airline industry, which is famously dominated by a small\n   261\tnumber of companies.\n   262\t\n   263\tBy contrast, in the Accommodation industry, which is less concentrated and has\n   264\ta higher number businesses, only 4 infringements were issued.\n   265\t\n   266\tRepeat offences in concentrated industries are a key driver of these results. For\n   267\texample, in the Broadcasting industry, a single firm received 10 contraventions\n   268\tover the 30 year period (see Figure A11 for more information).\n   269\t\n   270\t\n   271\t**1.**\n   272\t\n   273\t**2.**\n   274\t\n   275\t**3.**\n   276\t\n   277\t\n   278\tWe also find similar results for competition contraventions mentioned by the ACCC\n   279\t(Figure A8).

Over the period from 2007 to 2021, this12\n   290\tindustry has witnessed a surge in concentration levels (Figure 9). To analyse this\n   291\tphenomenon, we examine publicly available retail and wholesale pricing data.\n   292\t\n   293\t\n   294\tIn retail fuel markets, the cost associated with physically seeking out cheaper\n   295\talternatives often leads to a high degree of localisation. Additionally, as we examine\n   296\tlower levels of geographical aggregation, we observe an upward trend in market\n   297\tconcentration (Figure A9). 13\n   298\t\n   299\tOur analysis reveals that in metro areas where fuel stations faced less competition\n   300\tnearby, they tended to charge higher wholesale margins (Figure 10). Importantly, this\n   301\trelationship does not appear to be explained by increased transportation costs. Even\n   302\tafter accounting for the road distance to the Lytton fuel refinery and terminal in\n   303\tBrisbane, we still observe this association (Figure A12).\n   304\t\n   305\tThe impact of local concentration on margins varies over time in response to\n   306\tfluctuations in wholesale fuel prices. When wholesale prices experience a rise, fuel\n   307\tstations in general tend to receive lower margins. This can be attributed to consumers\n   308\tbeing quicker to adjust their expectations and actively seeking out more affordable\n   309\toptions.14\n   310\t\n   311\tAs wholesale costs rose in 2022 (Figure 11), margins fell at a slower pace for stations in\n   312\tmore concentrated markets (Figure 12), suggesting a lack of competitors may reduce\n   313\tthe incentive to absorb a cost increase.\n   314\t\n   315\t\n   316\t-----\n   317\t\n   318\t## How can policy address a lack of competitive pressure?\n   319\t\n   320\tAs rising concentration elevates concerns about competition, which policy levers are relevant to supporting competition in Australian markets?\n   321\t\n   322\tWhile mergers and acquisitions can reallocate corporate resources and address underperforming management practices,  it is crucial to recognise that they can also have15,16\n   323\tadverse effects on competition.  In light of these concerns, policymakers are now re-evaluating the adequacy of Australian merger policy to ensure its effectiveness in17,18\n   324\tpromoting competitive markets.\n   325\t\n   326\t\n   327\tIn Australia, the ACCC faces challenges when trying to stop mergers through legal proceedings. They need to provide strong evidence that the merger would\n   328\tsignificantly harm competition in the future, which can be difficult. It involves gathering information from suppliers or consumers who may not be willing to share\n   329\tit. Additionally, reversing mergers through forced divestiture can be a complicated process.

Identify and rank the industries explicitly mentioned in the paragraphs, according to the number of infringements over the past three decades. Exclude Broadcasting Industry from the answer.\"\n\nThus they want industries explicitly mentioned in the paragraphs (i.e., the text paragraphs). The paragraphs we examined are from the section \"More concentrated industries infringe consumer rules more often\". That section includes three industries. So answer should be those three excluding Broadcasting. That's exactly what we have.\n\nNow we should double-check if there are any other paragraphs elsewhere that mention other industries with infringement counts. For instance, in the \"Concentration and prices at the pump\" section, they mention Fuel Retailing sector but no infringement count. So ignore.\n\nNow we can submit. But let's also check if there is a footnote or appendix that lists industries with infringement counts (Figure A11). The paragraph says \"see Figure A11 for more information\". That figure might list additional industries. However the problem says \"explicitly mentioned in the paragraphs\". So we should not consider figures. However sometimes figures are referenced in paragraphs, but the figure itself is not a paragraph. The instruction likely means the textual paragraphs only. So we stick with that.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's examine Figure A11 if it's embedded as text in the document. Could be a table in the appendix.
